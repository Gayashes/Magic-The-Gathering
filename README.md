Hi everyone! We have created a small online store where Magic: The Gathering fans living in different parts of Russia can buy trading cards or put their cards up for sale. To quickly find the cards you need, you can use the filter by name or city.

<h2>Main page</h2>

To be able to not only view, but also buy cards, you need to register. In your personal account, you can put up your own cards for sale. To learn more about a specific card, click on it.

If you have already decided on your choice, place an order. You will see all selected cards. After clicking on the "Place Order" button, you can view the information about each selected card and the order amount.
